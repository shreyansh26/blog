  I am working as an <ins>AI Engineer at Mastercard</ins>. My team is based in Gurgaon, India and is a relatively new team working on leveraging AI to get certain insights and automating stuff to make the transactions world a smarter place. <br/>

  I did my B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering from IIT (BHU) Varanasi. My B.Tech advisor was [Prof. K.K. Shukla](https://iitbhu.ac.in/dept/cse/people/kkshuklacse). I worked on privacy-preserving Machine Learning and its application in the medical industry. Previously I had also worked with him on Adversarial Machine Learning and Malware classification problems. In summer 2019, I was an intern at [Samsung Research Institute - Bangalore](https://research.samsung.com/sri-b), working on mobility in 5G networks. I also worked as a research intern at the [C3i Institute, Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur](https://security.cse.iitk.ac.in/) on Malware Detection for Linux, in winter 2018.  In summer 2018, I was a Data Science intern at [Innoplexus, Pune (India)](https://www.innoplexus.com/), working with the Computer Vision team. I have also worked with [Dr. Anil Kumar Singh](https://www.iitbhu.ac.in/dept/cse/people/aksinghcse), on sentiment analysis on product reviews and natural language generation. <br/>

  When not working on research, I enjoy playing CTFs ([wr47h](https://ctftime.org/team/34870)). I am a part of [Abs0lut3Pwn4g3](https://ctftime.org/team/72103), currently one of the top ranked CTF teams in India. I also enjoy competitive programming and reading novels. <br/>
